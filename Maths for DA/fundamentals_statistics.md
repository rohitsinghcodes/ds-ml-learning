# Fundamentals of Statistics

## 1. Introduction
- Statistics: Science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data.  
- Types of Data:  
  - Quantitative (Numerical)  
  - Qualitative (Categorical)  

---

## 2. Data
- Raw Data: Original data collected from observations or experiments.  
- Frequency Distribution: Table showing **data values and their frequency**.  

---

## 3. Frequency
- Relative Frequency:  
  f_r = f / n  
  where f = frequency of a value, n = total number of observations  

- Cumulative Frequency:  
  CF = Σ f (sum of frequencies up to that value)

---

## 4. Measure of Central Tendency
- Mean:  
  x̄ = Σ xi / n  

- Median (odd n): Middle value  
- Median (even n): Average of two middle values  

- Mode: Most frequent value  

- Weighted Mean:  
  x̄_w = Σ(wi * xi) / Σ wi  

---

## 5. Measure of Dispersion
- Range:  
  Range = Maximum value - Minimum value  

- Variance (Population):  
  σ² = Σ(xi - μ)² / N  

- Variance (Sample):  
  s² = Σ(xi - x̄)² / (n - 1)  

- Standard Deviation:  
  σ = √σ² , s = √s²  

---

## 6. Measure of Relative Dispersion
- Coefficient of Variation (CV):  
  CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean) * 100  

- Quartile Deviation (QD):  
  QD = (Q3 - Q1) / 2  

- Relative Quartile Deviation (RQD):  
  RQD = (Q3 - Q1) / (Q3 + Q1)  

---

## 7. Measure of Shape
- Skewness: Measures asymmetry of distribution  
  - Pearson’s Skewness:  
    Sk = 3 * (Mean - Median) / Standard Deviation  

- Kurtosis: Measures peakedness of distribution  
  - Positive kurtosis: Leptokurtic (peaked)  
  - Zero kurtosis: Mesokurtic (normal)  
  - Negative kurtosis: Platykurtic (flat)
