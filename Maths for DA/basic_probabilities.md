# Basic Probabilities

## 1. Introduction
- Probability of an event A:  
  P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes

---

## 2. Rules
- Complement Rule:  
  P(A') = 1 - P(A)

- Addition Rule (mutually exclusive events):  
  P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)

- General Addition Rule:  
  P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

- Multiplication Rule (independent events):  
  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)

## 3. Random Experiment
- Definition: An experiment that can result in **one of many possible outcomes**.  
- Probability formulas remain the same:  
  P(A) = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes

---

## 4. Sample Space
- Total possible outcomes of an experiment: **S**  
- Probability:  
  P(A) = Number of outcomes in A / Number of outcomes in S

---

## 5. Permutations and Combinations
- Permutations (n objects, r at a time):  
  nPr = n! / (n - r)!  

- Combinations (n objects, r at a time):  
  nCr = n! / [r! * (n - r)!]

## 6. Union and Intersection | Venn Diagram
- Union:  
  P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

- Intersection:  
  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) (if independent)

- Venn Diagram: Use to visualize sets and calculate probabilities using formulas above.

## 7. Joint and Conditional Probability
- Conditional Probability:  
  P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

- Joint Probability:  
  P(A ∩ B) = Probability that **both events occur together**

---

## 8. Bayes’ Theorem
- Formula:  
  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
