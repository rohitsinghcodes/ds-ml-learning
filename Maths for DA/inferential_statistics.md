# Inferential Statistics

## 1. Population and Sample
- Population: Complete set of observations  
- Sample: Subset of population  
- Sample Mean: x̄ = Σ xi / n  
- Population Mean: μ = Σ Xi / N  

---

## 2. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- For large n, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches normal distribution:  
  Mean: μ_x̄ = μ  
  Standard Error: σ_x̄ = σ / √n  

---

## 3. Confidence Interval (Part 1: Population σ known)
- CI = x̄ ± Z * (σ / √n)  
- Z: Standard normal value for desired confidence level  

---

## 4. Confidence Interval (Part 2: Population σ unknown)
- CI = x̄ ± t * (s / √n)  
- t: t-distribution value for desired confidence level and degrees of freedom (n-1)  

---

## 5. Hypothesis Testing
- Null Hypothesis (H0): Statement to test  
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Opposite of H0  
- Decision Rule based on p-value or test statistic  

---

## 6. Z-Test
- Test statistic:  
  Z = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)  

---

## 7. T-Test
- Test statistic (sample σ unknown):  
  t = (x̄ - μ) / (s / √n)  

---

## 8. Chi-Squared Test
- Test statistic:  
  χ² = Σ ((O - E)² / E)  
- O = Observed frequency  
- E = Expected frequency
